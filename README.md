## Requirements

1. Flutterwave for business [API Keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/authentication)
2. Supported Flutter version >= 1.17.0


## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your project. In your `pubspec.yaml` file add: `flutterwave_standard: 1.0.5`
2. Run `flutter pub get`


## Usage

### Initializing a Flutterwave instance

To create an instance, you should call the Flutterwave constructor. This constructor accepts a mandatory instance of the following:

- The calling `Context`
- `publicKey`
- `Customer`
- `amount`
- `email`
- `fullName`
- `txRef`
- `isTestMode`
- `paymentOptions`
- `redirectUrl`
- `Customization`

It returns an instance of Flutterwave which we then call the async method `.charge()` on.

_

    handlePaymentInitialization() async { 
    	 final Customer customer = Customer(
    	 name: "Flutterwave Developer",
    	 phoneNumber: "1234566677777",   
         email: "customer@customer.com"  
     );            
        final Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave(
	        context: context, publicKey: "Public Key-here,
    		currency: "currency-here",   
            redirectUrl: "add-your-redirect-url-here"   
            txRef: "add-your-unique-reference-here",   
            amount: "3000",   
            customer: customer,   
            paymentOptions: "ussd, card, barter, payattitude",   
            customization: Customization(title: "My Payment"),
            isTestMode: true );
     } 

### Handling the response

Calling the `.charge()` method returns a `Future` of `ChargeResponse` which we await for the actual response as seen above.



    final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.charge(); 

Call the verify transaction [endpoint](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/verifications/transaction) with the `transactionID` returned in `response.transactionId` or the `txRef` you provided to verify transaction before offering value to customer

#### Note

- `ChargeResponse` can be null, depending on if the user cancels the transaction by pressing back.
- You need to confirm the transaction is successful. Ensure that the txRef, amount, and status are correct and successful. Be sure to [verify the transaction details](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/verifications/transaction) before providing value.
- Some payment methods are not instant, such a `Pay with Bank Transfers, Pay with Bank`, and so you would need to rely on [webhooks](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/webhooks) or call the transaction verification service using the [`transactionId`](https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference/endpoints/transactions#verify-a-transaction), or transaction reference you created(`txRef`)
- For such long payments like the above, closing the payment page returns a `cancelled` status, so your final source of truth has to be calling the transaction verification service.
